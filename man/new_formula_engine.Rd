\title{Create a new formula engine}
\usage{
new_formula_engine(mold, forge, intercept = FALSE, info = NULL,
  formula = NULL, indicators = TRUE, ..., subclass = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{mold}{A named list with two elements, \code{clean} and \code{process}, see
the \code{\link[=new_engine]{new_engine()}} section, Mold Functions, for details.}

\item{forge}{A named list with two elements, \code{clean} and \code{process}, see
the \code{\link[=new_engine]{new_engine()}} section, Forge Functions, for details.}

\item{intercept}{A logical. Should an intercept be included in the
processed data? This information is used by the \code{process} function
in the \code{mold} and \code{forge} function list.}

\item{info}{Either \code{NULL}, or a named list with 2 elements, \code{predictors}
and \code{outcomes}. \code{info} is generated automatically at \code{\link[=mold]{mold()}} time and
is used to validate \code{new_data} at prediction time. The
information in \code{predictors} is the \code{predictors$info} element from running
\code{engine$mold$process()} and the information is \code{outcomes} is the
corresponding \code{outcomes$info}.}

\item{formula}{Either \code{NULL}, or a formula that specifies how the
predictors and outcomes should be preprocessed. This argument is set
automatically at \code{\link[=mold]{mold()}} time.}

\item{indicators}{A logical. Should factors be expanded into dummy variables?}

\item{...}{Name-value pairs for additional elements of engines that
subclass this engine.}

\item{subclass}{A character vector. The subclasses of this engine.}
}
\value{
A preprocessing engine with the class, \code{"formula_engine"}.
}
\description{
This is the base class for a formula preprocessing engine. If you want to
create a new preprocessing engine that accepts input from the user in the
form of a formula, start here.
